    Hey there! I’m a born and bred, dyed-in-the-wool, true East End Londoner and British ex-patriate who’s been living in Poland since 2004 with my family. 
    I’m a TEFL course-trained English language teacher and I’ve been teaching English here since 2005.
    I’ve worked in religious schools, private and state- run schools. I’ve also done language camps for the past three years and I’ve had a private English teaching business. 
    If you are looking to improve your level of general, business or legal English, if you seek advice, 
    help and tutoring in order to pass an exam such as B2, FCE, CAE, CPE, IELTS or if you simply wish to improve your ability to overcome the dreaded language barrier and speak better general English, 
    feel free to get in touch with me via my email (that can be found in the contact section) telling me where you want your English to take you, and I’ll be more than happy to help!
    I’m really looking forward to hearing from YOU! Have a tremendous day!!
